# Snackbar demo

This application is a simple demo application containing the following domains:
 - Maintaining the snackbar inventory
 - Creating an order

The architecture is based on Domain Driven Design with Laravel used as framework.

Right now it's still a work-in-progress!! The only endpoint implemented right now is adding an item to the inventory.
